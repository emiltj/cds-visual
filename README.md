# Visual Analytics - Spring 2021

This repository contains all of the assignments and code-along sessions of the Visual Analytics course.

## Running my scripts

For running my scripts I'd recommend doing the following from your terminal (and remembering to use the new environment that it creates):

__MAC/LINUX/WORKER02__
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emiltj/cds-visual.git
cd cds-visual
bash ./create_lang_venv.sh
```
__WINDOWS:__
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emiltj/cds-visual.git
cd cds-visual
bash ./create_lang_venv_win.sh
```

## Repo structure and files

This repository has the following directory structure:

| Column | Description|
|--------|:-----------|
```data```| Contains the data used in both the scripts and the notebooks
```notebooks``` | Contains the notebooks (code along sessions)
```src``` | Contains the assignments
```utils``` | Utility functions written by [Ross](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/ross-deans-kristensenmclachlan(29ad140e-0785-4e07-bdc1-8af12f15856c).html) which are utilised in some of the scripts

Furthermore it contains the files:
